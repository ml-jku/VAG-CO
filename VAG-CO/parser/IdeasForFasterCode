- make EnergyGraphs directed and adapt the GNN code accordingly
- move BFS and initial igraph -> Jgraph conversion to Dataloader
- remove selfloops and use moving average for normalization instead
- maybe make forward passes on CPU
- when normlization is removed edges and nodes could be simply integer arrays
